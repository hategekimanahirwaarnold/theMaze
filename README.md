# 3D Maze
### Creating a 3D maze with raycasting

I'm excited to share one my latest interesting project, "maze"! ðŸŽ®

Why "maze," you ask? Well, let me share a little story behind its creation. When I sat down to brainstorm my next project, I wanted to challenge myself and create something truly immersive. That's when the idea of creating maze with SDL2 and raycasting technology struck me.

The maze represents life's journey, full of twists and turns, challenges, and rewards. Through "maze," I wanted to create an experience that not only entertains but also inspires and provokes thought.

I invite you to step into the world of "maze" and experience the thrill of exploration and discovery.
